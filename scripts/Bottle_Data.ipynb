    "### Purpose\n",
    "This notebook provides a quick outline and example of working with OOI Discrete Summary Spreadsheet bottle data. It includes how to load it, how to parse data quality flags, how to derive some important values, etc.\n",

    "At each [boiler plate stuff about OOI cruises]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "The cruise data is hosted on OOI's Alfresco document server at https://alfresco.oceanobservatories.org, hereafter reffered to as Alfresco. Cruise data is hosted under OOI > {Array} > Cruise Data > {Cruise}. Cruise data includes the following key pieces of information: Cruise Reports, Ship Data (e.g. sonars, underway instruments, etc.), CTD and Water Sampling Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are principally concerned with the Water Sampling data, which can be found under {Cruise} > Ship Data > Water Sampling. The Water Sampling folder contains both digitized and scanned CTD logs as well as the results from the labs for each ."
