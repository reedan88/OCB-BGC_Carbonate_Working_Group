Welcome, this repo provides starter code, example notebooks, and example data for
getting started working with Ocean Observatories Initiative Carbon System Sensors.

## Purpose


## Project Files Description


## Setup

0. **Make an account on OOINet**
First, please go to https://ooinet.oceanobservatories.org/ and make an register. Once you have made an account for yourself and logged in, navigate to your account settings by clicking on "User Profile" under your email in the top right corner of your screen.

#### Dependencies
The example notebooks in this repo rely heavily on packages, functions, and routines that have been developed over the years by the OOI operators to assist in processing and working with OOI data. There are two principle repos on which

* ##### OOINet
* ##### OOI-Data-Explorations

These repos are not distributed, so they will need to be either cloned to your local machine or the files and functions directly downloaded.
